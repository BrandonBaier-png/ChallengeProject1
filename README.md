# ChallengeProject1

  The intent is to make a small command line game taking inspiration from the battleship game from project 2. The projectâ€™s visuals will update every time a key is pressed similar to the battleship updating upon confirming a target location

  The game will create 4 columns with some targets descending down the screen. The player will have to press the right key once the object reaches the zone indicating to strike, kind of like the game guitar hero. The player will have to press them in the correct order 

	I plan to use multiple arrays to accomplish this project. For starters, displaying the grid pattern of the targets will require two arrays, keeping track of the order of the targets will need at least one, and determining the effect of a key being pressed will likely call an array.
